'''
1. Nested Decisions: The Adventure Game üè∞
Objective:

To practice the use of nested if statements in creating a simple text-based adventure game.

Task 1: Code Correction

You are provided with a Python script that is supposed to guide a user through an adventure game, but it has some errors. Identify and fix them.

Buggy Code:

place = input("Choose a place: forest or cave? ")

if place = "forest":
    action = input("climb a tree or cross a river?")
    if action = "climb a tree":
        print("You found a bird's nest!")
    else action = "cross a river":
        print("You found a boat!")
elif place = "cave":
    print("You find a hidden treasure!")
Task 2: Setting the Scene

Based on the corrected code from Task 1, expand the game. If the user chooses "cave", ask them if they want to "light a torch" or "proceed in the dark", and provide outcomes for each decision.

Task 3: Default Path

If the user makes an invalid choice at any point, use the pass statement for now. Later, you can enhance this to provide feedback or a different branch of the story.
